# Data_cleaning 
+ This projects contains 3 datasets :
 + Dataset 1 is BL-Flickr-Images-Book.csv which contains book details from British Library
 + Dataset 2 is university_towns.txt is a text file containing names of college towns in every US state
 + Dataset 3 is olympics.csv which contains number of medals won by different countries in summer and winter olympics

 + All these files have data which needs to be cleaned and are messy

+ The following code covers:
 + Dropping unnecessary columns in a DataFrame
 + Changing the index of a DataFrame
 + Using .str() methods to clean columns
 + Using the DataFrame.applymap() function to clean the entire dataset, element-wise
 + Renaming columns to a more recognizable set of labels\n
 + Skipping unnecessary rows in a CSV file
